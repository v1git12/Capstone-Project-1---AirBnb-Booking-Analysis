# EDA on NYC Airbnb Bookings

## Introduction
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the NYC Airbnb bookings dataset. The goal is to gain insights and understand the patterns and trends in the data to make informed decisions and recommendations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the NYC Airbnb bookings dataset. It contains information about various Airbnb listings in New York City, including details such as listing prices, neighborhood information, availability, and guest reviews. The dataset provides a rich source of information to explore and analyze.

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
- Understand the distribution of Airbnb listings across different neighborhoods in NYC.
- Analyze the pricing trends and factors influencing listing prices.
- Identify popular listing types and room types.
- Investigate the availability of listings throughout the year.
- Explore the correlation between listing attributes and customer reviews.
- Extract meaningful insights to guide decision-making for hosts and potential guests.

## Tools and Techniques Used
The analysis is performed using Python and various data analysis and visualization libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Jupyter Notebook is used as the development environment for the code and analysis, making it interactive and easy to reproduce.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- `Airbnb NYC 2019.csv/`: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- `Team_colab_AirBnb_Booking_Analysis.ipynb/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook files with the code and analysis.
- `README.md`: This readme file providing an overview of the project.

## Usage
To reproduce the analysis and explore the EDA on NYC Airbnb bookings, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Team_colab_AirBnb_Booking_Analysis.ipynb` to access the code and analysis.
4. Execute the code cells in the notebook to perform the EDA and generate visualizations.
5. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to further analyze or visualize the data.

## Conclusion
This project offers valuable insights into the NYC Airbnb bookings dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis. By understanding the trends, patterns, and factors influencing Airbnb listings, stakeholders can make informed decisions to enhance their hosting experience or make informed choices as potential guests. The findings and visualizations generated in this analysis can serve as a foundation for more advanced modeling and decision-making processes.
